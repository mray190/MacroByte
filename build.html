					<section id="radio" class="wrapper style1">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2 class="major">Establishing connections with other microbits</h2>
							<p><br>
							To start with, let’s send a message over the radio. Wireless communication is pretty complicated: the text has to be converted into a number, then into digital symbols, then into different radio waves, and finally sent through circuits to an antenna. Fortunately, the micro:bit does all the hard stuff for you!</p><p>
							On the sending micro:bit, use this code:</p>
							<pre><code>radio.setGroup(42);
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, () => { 
    radio.sendString("Taco");
});</code></pre>
							<p>The first line tells the radio what channel to use. Both micro:bits need to be on the same channel in order to talk to each other. The radio.sendString function tells the micro:bit to transmit the word “Taco” from the radio</p><p>
							On the receiving micro:bit, use this code:</p>
							<pre><code>radio.setGroup(42);
radio.onDataReceived(() => {
    // Do stuff here!
});</code></pre>
							<p>The first line is the same as in the send code. It makes sure both micro:bits are on the same channel. The rest of the code tells the micro:bit what to do when it receives a message from the radio. In this case, it displays the message on the screen.</p>
							<p>Try it with your two micro:bits. The receiving micro:bit should show the word “Taco” on the screen when you push the button on the sending micro:bit.</p>

				<!-- Ciphers -->
					<section id="ciphers" class="wrapper style2">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2 class="major">Create your own ciphers!</h2>
							<p>[FIG: eavesdropping cartoon]</p><p>
							When the micro:bit sends a message over the radio, any other nearby micro:bit on the same channel can see it. The Internet works the same way: when you send a “packet” of data to the server, everyone else on the same network can see it too. How can we protect the information when anyone can see it?</p><p>
							[FIG: scrambling messages]</p><p>
							To protect a message that’s transmitted in public, we have to scramble it so that the person who’s supposed to see it can unscramble it, but no one else can. In the world of information security, the scrambled message is called <i>ciphertext</i> and the rule that’s used to scramble it is called a <i>cipher</i>. For a cipher to work, it has to combine the message with another secret that only the sender and receiver know. This secret is sometimes called a <i>key</i>. Anyone who knows the key can decipher the message, and everyone else will just get nonsense.</p>
							<p><blockquote>It’s important to keep the key a secret, or else anyone can decipher the message. The strongest lock in the world is no good if everyone has the key! The same is true of passwords. The easiest way to steal secret information from an encrypted system isn’t to break the code – it’s to trick someone into telling you their password.</blockquote></p>
						</div>
					</section>

				<!-- Caesar -->
					<section id="caesar" class="wrapper style4">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2 class="major">Caesar Cipher</h2>
							<p>The first cipher we’ll program is called the <i>Caesar cipher</i>. It’s named after the ancient Roman ruler, who reportedly used it to send orders to his armies. The Caesar cipher is a kind of <i>substitution ciphers</i>, in which each letter is replaced by a specific other letter. Here’s an example:</p><p>
							[FIG: Caesar cipher + 1]</p><p>
							Can you guess how it works? Every letter is replaced by the next letter in the alphabet. To make it harder to predict, we can use other offsets. For example, with an offset of 4, we’d replace A with E, B with F, etc. When we get to Z, we have to wrap around and start with A again. So with the offset of 4, W would be replaced with A, X with B, Y with C, and Z with D.</p><p>
							To program the cipher into a computer, we first convert every letter into a number: A is 0, B is 1, and so on. Then we add the offset. To wrap around, we use the “modulo” operation, which is the % sign in computer code. Then convert the number back into a letter and send it over the channel. Here’s the code:</p>
							<pre><code>radio.setGroup(42);
var shift_amount = 5;

var plain_text = "Taco";
var encoded_text = "";
for (var i=0; i < plain_text.length; i++) {
	var char_as_number = plain_text[i].charCodeAt(0);
	var shifted_number = char_as_number - shift_amount;
	var new_char = String.fromCharCode(shifted_number);
    encoded_text += new_char;
}
radio.sendString(encoded_text);</code></pre>
							<a href="code_src/caesar_send.hex" class="button small fit icon fa-download" download>Download</a><p><br>
							The receiving micro:bit does the same thing, but it subtracts the offset instead of adding it:</p>
							<pre><code>radio.setGroup(42);
var shift_amount = 5;

radio.onDataReceived(() => {
    var encoded_message = radio.receiveString();
    var result = "";
    for (var i = 0; i < encoded_message.length; i++) {
		var char_as_number = encoded_message[i].charCodeAt(0);
		var shifted_number = char_as_number + shift_amount;
		var new_char = String.fromCharCode(shifted_number);
        result += new_char;
    }
    basic.showString(result);
});</code></pre>
							<a href="code_src/caesar_receive.hex" class="button small fit icon fa-download" download>Download</a><p><br>
							Try transmitting a message again. If the receiver knows the offset that the sender used, it should display the same message that was sent. Now try changing the offset and see what happens. The cipher makes it much more difficult to eavesdrop on the radio transmissions.</p>					
						</div>
					</section>

				<!-- Addition -->
					<section id="addition" class="wrapper style1">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2 class="major">Addition Cipher</h2>
							<p>Caesar ciphers are easy to understand and code, but they’re also easy to break. You just need to figure out the offset. It wouldn’t take very long to try all 26 possible offsets. One way to improve the cipher is to assign the substitute letters in an arbitrary way: A to M, N to L, D to X, and so on. Just make sure that every letter has a different substitute. Then there are about 403 million billion billion ways to assign the letters!</p><p>
							<p><blockquote>Since there are so many possible combinations of letters, it’s much harder to break this cipher by brute force, but it can be done by looking for patterns in the letters. Some letters occur more often than some other letters – E is much more common than X, for example – and some letters often appear together, like Q and U. Computers are very good at finding these patterns, so substitution ciphers are not very secure today.</blockquote></p>
							<p>Here’s a different kind of cipher that also uses the “modulo” function. Can you figure out how it works? Can you figure out how to break it?</p>

				<!-- Image -->
					<section id="image" class="wrapper style2">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2 class="major">Image Cipher</h2>
							<h3>Transferring images</h3>
							<p>So far, we’ve scrambled text data by replacing some letters with others. But what if we want to protect an image, or an audio clip, or any other type of digital file? Computers store and transmit information as 0’s and 1’s. These numbers are called “bits”, and they can be used to represent any kind of information in a computer. If we can design a way to scramble the 0’s and 1’s, we can protect any type of data. The encryption schemes used on computers today all treat data as numbers, no matter what kind of information the data represents.</p><p>
							The micro:bit makes it easy to view and send this kind of data. We’ll use the display to show an “image” made up of 25 lights. A light that’s on represents a 1, and a light that’s off represents a 0. There are 25 lights on the micro-bit, so our message will have 25 bits. First, let’s write some code to send and receive these images:</p>
							<p>Receiving:</p>
							<pre><code>radio.setGroup(42);

radio.onDataReceived(() => {
    var image = radio.receiveString();
    for (var i = 0; i < image.length; i++) {
        if (parseInt(image[i])) {
            led.plot(i % 5, i / 5)
        } else {
            led.unplot(i % 5, i / 5)
        }
    }
});</code></pre>
							<a href="code_src/image_receive.hex" class="button small fit icon fa-download" download>Download</a><p><br>
						Sending:</p>
						<pre><code>radio.setGroup(42);
var image = "0101001010000001000101110";

radio.sendString(image);</code></pre>
							<a href="code_src/image_send.hex" class="button small fit icon fa-download" download>Download</a><p>
						<h3>Encoding images</h3>
						<p>Now let’s protect this image. We’re going to use a bit flip cipher, uses another “image” of 0’s and 1’s as its secret key. To encode the message, line up its bits with the bits of the secret key. If the secret key has a 1, then flip the bit of the message. If the secret key has a 0, then leave that bit of the message alone.</p>
						<p>[FIG: bit flipping diagram]</p>
						<p>If anyone tries to look at the image without knowing the secret key, they’ll just see random bits!</p>
						<p>Here’s the code for the sender:</p>
						<pre><code>radio.setGroup(42);
var image = "0101001010000001000101110";
var key = "1001101100111000010111111";

var encoded_message = "";
for (var i = 0; i < image.length; i++) {
    encoded_message += ('' + ((parseInt(image[i]) + parseInt(key[i])) % 2))
}
radio.sendString(encoded_message);</code></pre>
							<a href="code_src/image_encrypted_send.hex" class="button small fit icon fa-download" download>Download</a><p><br>
						And here’s the code for the receiver:</p>
						<pre><code>radio.setGroup(42);
var key = "1001101100111000010111111";

radio.onDataReceived(() => {
    var encoded_message = radio.receiveString();
    for (var i = 0; i < encoded_message.length; i++) {
        if (((parseInt(encoded_message[i]) + parseInt(key[i])) % 2)) {
            led.plot(i % 5, i / 5)
        } else {
            led.unplot(i % 5, i / 5)
        }
    }
});</code></pre>
							<a href="code_src/image_encrypted_receive.hex" class="button small fit icon fa-download" download>Download</a><p><br>
						Do you notice anything strange about the code? The encoding and decoding operations are exactly the same! Every bit that has been flipped gets flipped back to where it started, and the bits that weren’t flipped are left alone. </p><p>
						Bit flipping ciphers might seem strange, but they’re incredibly useful. Not only are they simple, [b]they’re completely unbreakable[/b]! If the cipher is used correctly, it is mathematically impossible to learn any information about the message. What’s the catch? To guarantee that it’s unbreakable, each set of secret bits can only be used once. The more messages that are sent with the same key, the less secure the messages become.</p><p>
						<blockquote>There’s one other catch to bit flip ciphers. To be secure, the pattern has to be totally random. The “random” numbers generated by computer software are good enough for shuffling music or rolling dice in games, but they’re not random enough for encryption. Some computer chips have special features to generate better random numbers using noise from electronic circuits. Randomness lies at the heart of nearly every encryption scheme!</blockquote></p><p>
						Because of this one-and-done rule, the bit flip cipher is known as a <i>one-time pad</i>. Since it’s difficult to generate and share a different key for every message, these ciphers are only used for the most sensitive messages. </p><p>
						<blockquote>The key is often the weakest link in an encryption system. A lot of cutting-edge security research today is on secure ways to create and share keys over networks. Some scientists are developing ways to use quantum physics to share keys over special fiber-optic cables. The safest way, of course, is to hand the key to someone in person.</blockquote></p>

				<!-- Vignere -->
					<section id="vignere" class="wrapper style4">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2 class="major">Vigenère Cipher</h2>
							The Vigenère cipher is a more advanced version of the Caesar cipher. Just like the Caesar cipher, each letter is replaced by a specific other letter through an offset; however, the offset changes throughout the message! To do this, the Vigenère cipher uses a key to tell the cipher how much to shift each letter. For example, using “badger” as the key would use the offset values “1, 0, 3, 6, 17”, determined from the letter’s distance from the letter a (b is 1 away, d is 3 away, etc.). This means the message would have its first letter shifted by 1, its second letter shifted by 0, and so on. Once we’ve used all the values in the key, we start over again, so the sixth letter would again be shifted by 1.<p><p>
							Here's the code for the sender:
							<pre><code>radio.setGroup(42);
var vignere_key = "Badger";

var plain_text = "Taco Vignere";
var encoded_text = "";
var vignere_index = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < plain_text.length; i++) {
    vignere_index = i % vignere_key.length;
    encoded_text += String.fromCharCode(plain_text[i].charCodeAt(0) + vignere_key[i].charCodeAt(vignere_index));
}

radio.sendString(encoded_text);</code></pre>
<a href="code_src/vignere_send.hex" class="button small fit icon fa-download" download>Download</a><br>
In order to decode the Vigenère cipher, you need to know the key! Once you do, it’s as simple as performing the cipher backwards, shifting each letter backwards by the same value.<p><p>
							Here's how we do it:
							<pre><code>radio.setGroup(42);
var vignere_key = "Badger"

radio.onDataReceived(() => {
    var encoded_text = radio.receiveString();
    var plain_text = "";
    var vignere_index = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < encoded_text.length; i++) {
        vignere_index = i % vignere_key.length;
        plain_text += String.fromCharCode(encoded_text[i].charCodeAt(0) - vignere_key[i].charCodeAt(vignere_index));
    }
    basic.showString(plain_text);

							<h2 class="major">Pig Latin Cipher</h2>
							Pig latin is a really simple way to make everyday words sound confusing! For every word, take the first syllable of the word and put it at the end of the word. Then, add “ay” to the word. For example “pig latin” would become “igpay atinlay”. Because it’s so simple, you can every try it out loud!<p>
For our computer version of pig latin, we take the first letter (instead of syllable) of every word and put it at the end. Then, we add “ay” at the end. Try out the code for yourself! Unlike other ciphers, however, this one is still pretty easy to read, so it’s not very secure…<p>

							Here's the code for the sender:
							<pre><code>radio.setGroup(42);
var plain_text = "Monkey";

var encoded_text = "";
for (var i = 1; i < plain_text.length; i++) {
    encoded_text += plain_text[i];

							<a href="code_src/piglatin_send.hex" class="button small fit icon fa-download" download>Download</a><br>
							To unscramble the secret message, our computer program removes “ay” from the end of the word and then takes the last letter and puts it at the front. Pretty simple!<p><p>

							<h2 class="major">Modern Encryption</h2>
							<p>The ciphers in this demo project can be used to protect messages from eavesdroppers. They’re much better than sending a plain message, but they each have weaknesses. The substitution ciphers can be broken by a determined adversary. The one-time-pad, while secure, isn’t practical for everyday use.</p><p>
							Today’s state-of-the-art encryption systems use a combination of these approaches. The data is encoded using a bit flip cipher, but it’s not a randomly generated one-time-pad. Instead, the bits are created according to a rule from a smaller secret key. These methods are breakable in theory, but to decode the messages without the secret key, an adversary would have to solve a math problem so hard that even our fastest computers would take centuries to do it.
