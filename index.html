						<h2>The Team</h2>
						This project was designed and developed for the ARM Intern Innovation Challenge. In order to make something cool, our team members had to put on their thinking caps and think like kids! Here’s the team:

								<h2>Sam Schwebach</h2>
								A Minnesota Native, Sam is a Masters student at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he studies computer architecture. As an intern at ARM he has worked in verifying designs for a dynamic memory controller, in addition to perfecting his foosball skills! He has worked extensively with Android application development in the past, including a kid-themed app, and is very excited to be working with the micro:bit!

						<h2>The Challenge</h2>
The BBC micro:bit is an amazing piece of technology that is available to all Year 7 students in the UK. It provides all the basic building blocks of a computer in a small, affordable package. Even better, the tools and support that come with it mean that everyone can easily create something really cool! The possibilities are endless! <p><p>
With ARM’s Intern Innovation challenge, teams have been tasked with showing some cool things people can build with the Micro:Bit. In the spirit of the micro:bit, these activities are designed to introduce the ideas behind computers and programming to youth (after all, Year 7 students get one for free!). Such an activity is likely to be fairly simple, but fascinating nonetheless! For the interns of ARM, a company whose greatest assets are its innovative values and people, that should be a simple task!<p>
For our activity, we wanted to create something fun and engaging to teach kids about the basics of cryptography. As more and more data is becoming available online through the cloud, it’s becoming super important to make sure all that data is secure! While modern encryption methods are super-complicated processes designed by really smart people, the basics of making ciphers are actually pretty simple! Even better, learning how to make a “secret message” can be a very rewarding and fun activity! With our activity, in the form of a lesson, we provide information about some very basic cipher techniques, along with actual code to get them working on the micro:bit. After all, the best way to learn about the micro:bit is to get your hands dirty and actually code it!<p>

						<h2>Our Submission</h2>
						<p>
							The modern world is full of sensitive data. Servers on the Internet hold our credit card information, medical records, embarrassing music playlists, and less-than-flattering selfies. It’s hard to keep all that data safe from digital snoops. Almost every day there’s a new story about hackers stealing secrets. The field of <i>information security</i> has never been more important, but few people understand it. Even if you don’t write code or handle data for a living, it’s important to understand how your information can be protected – and how bad guys can break those protections!
						</p><p>
						In this project, you’ll use your BBC micro:bit, a tiny computer board that anyone can program, to send and receive secret messages. Program a text message or a small image into the micro:bit, then transmit it over the wireless radio to another micro:bit. With no protection, anyone else with a micro:bit could read the message too. You’ll learn how to scramble the message so that it can only be read by people you want to see it.</p><p>
						The tutorial (links below) will teach you several different ways to protect your messages. You’ll learn how to use the Caesar cipher, which was used to send military strategies in ancient Rome… and then learn how to crack it! We’ll also show you more modern methods that are used for data on the Internet. Try designing your own secret code and use it to send messages to your friends.</p>
